# To-do:
* Increase impact of lane changes
* look up acceleration profiles for cars (currently only binary)
    * Make "recovery" penalty to acceleration decay over time (probably)
* Add patience mechanics
* find research papers on patience in decision making
    * decision fatigue?
* start plotting travel time histogram but divided by socialness
